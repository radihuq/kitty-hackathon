# kitty-hackathon
## Social Budgeting

This project was built from December 3, 2019 to December 5, 2019 as part of the [Finastra Hack To The Future Hackathon](https://fintech.devpost.com/). Our team participated in the on-site Hackathon held at their Mississauga, Ontario office.

This project utilizes Finastra's [FusionFabric Platform](https://www.finastra.com/platform) to dynamically create new bank accounts.

The purpose of this project is to allow individuals to create a joint bank-account with their peers in order to pool money into a savings account.
