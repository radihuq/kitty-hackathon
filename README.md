## Social Budgeting

This project was built from December 3, 2019 to December 5, 2019 as part of the [Finastra Hack To The Future Hackathon](https://fintech.devpost.com/). Our team participated in the on-site Hackathon held at their Mississauga, Ontario office.

This project utilizes Finastra's [FusionFabric Platform](https://www.finastra.com/platform) to dynamically create new bank accounts.
